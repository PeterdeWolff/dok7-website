Website DOK7

Below you will find a short description of the website for clothing store “DOK7”  built for the first milestone project of the Code Institute full stack developer program.

DOK7 is a clothing store for men and women.  The store continuously updates their collection according to the latest fashion.  Pictures of their collection are often shown on social media like facebook and instagram.

The site is meant for (potential) customers who seek for information like:
-	Address
-	Opening hours
-	Brands
-	Pictures / impression of the store
-	About us / Team
-	Sale
-	References / blog
-	Links to social media

The site needs to present the basic information as mentioned above.
The live version can be found here 


UX

The goal for the visitors that are potential customers is to easily find information of the store like
-	Where is the store located
-	What are the opening hours
-	What brands do they sell
-	Who is working there

On the other hand the site must give them an impression of how the store looks.
As a visitor you can leave your email address to receive information like a newsletter or special events.  There is also the possibility to ask questions or give a comment in an open field/form.
Questions and remarks are not shown on the site.

The owner of the store can use to website to present their latest fashion and to announce upcoming events like extra opening hours or sales.
The owner receives customer info via the form what they can use for direct communication with the customer.  NOTE!!  There must be an opt-in to ask permission for sending newsletters and/or promotional information.
